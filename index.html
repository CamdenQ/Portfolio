          <h2 class="text-center">Meet Camden</h2>
			    <p>This is your quick elevator pitch to explain to people that visit your website:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Who you are.</li>
           <li>Where you live.</li>
           <li>What you do.</li>
           <li>And what makes you special.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Having a nice photograph of you at the top of this page will certainly help personalize this website and give new people a better sense of who you are.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
		    	<p>Your About section is your chance to explain in greater detail who you are and why someone should hire you. Take the time to explain more about you in greater detail than you would in your introduction. The key here is balance: having enough content to engage the reader, yet not too much where you'll lose their attention span. Have I lost yours yet? :)</p>
		    	<h3>Things that can be useful here:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>List of <b>Programming Languages</b> you know (and how well you know them).</li>
          <li><b>Education</b> or certificates.</li>
          <li><b>Hobbies</b> that are appropriate to share.</li>
          <li>Links to relevant <b>social media</b> profiles.</li>
          <li><b>Testimonial</b> (kind words others would say about you.</li>
          <li>Anything else unique about you?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important that you know yourself well enough so you can explain to others how you can help them. Being able to assure potential clients and employers that you understand them and their needs is key. Sometimes you'll want to make sure the world knows that you are willing to take on any size project, nothing is too large or too small. Or maybe you found a nitch and you want to tailor your limited resources to a spectific market. The more clear you are, the more comfortable your potential clients will be in contacting you.</p>

        <p>Maybe you wanna share how much you like:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Espresso (I don't)</li>
          <li>Americano (It's awful)</li>
          <li>Cold Brew (Coffee is disgusting)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is just a placeholder with that <a href="https://github.com/Morrivar/Pizza">silly test repo</a> to show what a project article might look like with a link in the title.</p>
        <p>I would make an article like this for each project I wanted to showcase.</p>
