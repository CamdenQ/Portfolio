          <p>
            Hello there! I'm Camden Miller, a web developer and all around dork
            from Florida. I love languages (both the people kind and the
            computer kind) and all things traditionally nerdy.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="about">
          <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>

          <p>
            Computers and the Internet have been the primary focus of every part
            of my non-professional life, from spending way too many hours in
            online chat boards to raiding giant monsters with a party of
            like-minded adventurers into the wee hours of the morning, and I've
            finally decided to take that focus into my career as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the current challenges facing the world, I decided to take my
            newfound free time and make a much needed career change. Now, as a
            newly-minted Full-Stack Web Developer, I couldn't be more excited to
            work with a team of skilled and passionate developers and get this
            career started right!
          </p>

          <h3>
            I'm still learning what sort of work is even out there, but here's
            some challenges I'd love to tackle professionally:
          </h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Responsive Web Development</li>
            <li>Mobile App Development</li>
            <li>Chrome Extensions</li>
            <li>Cloud-based Technology</li>
            <li>Website Management</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I really look forward to astounding (and hopefully not annoying) my
            future teammates and coworkers with the sheer volume of random,
            useless trivia I have tucked away.

              id="dekker-img"

              >DEKKER: An MTG Deck Builder</a
            >
          </h2>

          <p>
            DEKKER is a deck-building app for the popular trading card game
            <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            With DEKKER, the user can browse and sort the cards available,
            create decks from those cards, and add cards to or remove cards from
            existing decks.
          </p>

          <p>
            DEKKER is a completely solo endeavor. It's still a work in progress,
            but I'm pretty pleased with this first stage. This version took
            roughly two weeks to make, mostly due to it being the first
            full-stack application I had built on my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            Planned improvements include incorporating user registration and
            authentication, hooking in the official MTG API rather than relying
            on a custom cards database, adding even more filter options, and
            improving the UI and UX.
          </p>

          <p>
            A long-term goal is to eventually add other card games to DEKKER so
            that it can be a central resource for all of your trading card game
            deck building needs
          </p>

              >BuddyUp: Find local activities and people</a
            >
          </h2>

          <p>
            BuddyUp is an app designed to help users link up with people in
            their area for specific activities. The app is primarily designed
            with users in mind who may not know anybody locally but still want
            to have some company when they go out. With BuddyUp, all the user
            needs to do is post their activity or find one that's already been
            posted in their area.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a proof of concept, so many concerns, especially security
            conserns beyond basic authentication, are left unhandled.
          </p>

          <p>
            I worked on a team of three for this project. I was responsible for
            90% of the API. The authentication middleware and endpoints were
            plugged in by another team member from a boilerplate we all had
            access to, and he did the API testing as well. Every other part of
            the API was built by me alone. I also had a hand in several React
            components of the client (including the activity signup component
            and the list of user signups on the account page), though most of
            the front-end and 100% of the design were another team member's
            work.

          </h2>

          <p>
            This app was another proof of concept, this time built as part of a
            two-man team. It was built in about a day with very specific
            requirements, including that it use a spaced repetition algorithm to
            assist the user learning words in a foreign language.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea was to simulate working on an existing code-base to
            implement features. The database was already built, and we had to
            design and implement the algoritm on the back end as well as build
            the front end.
          </p>

          <p>The work was completed in about a day's worth of man hours.</p>
